# Instructions  

For this exercise, you will take the resulting file from Exercise 2.2 and style it up. This will allow you to add some visual interest to a project you have already worked on.

1. Download your solution file to Exercise 2.2 and re-upload it here (or copy and paste its contents into this `index.html` file).
1. Add a `<link>` element to your file that connects `style.css` as an external stylesheet.
1. Use `style.css` as your stylesheet to add whatever styles you wish.

Some Specifics:

* You must use some coloring, whether it be background colors or text colors. A common thing is to re-color links from the classic blue.
* You must set `font-family` and `font-size` for every tag in your file.
* You must use a border somewhere in your file.
* If you didn't use them in the past, feel free to add tags for outlining like `<article>`, `<section>` and `<aside>` and style those. For example, you might find a way to align an `<aside>` element off to the side. Or make it a sidebar.
* Consider adding background colors to things like header elements.
* Consider reducing the overall width of the body text so that it's easier to read.
* Play around with padding and margin (see the [W3Schools CSS reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php) for more details).

If there's something you would like to try to do but can't figure out how to make it happen, talk to the instructor! We'll figure something out!

Have some fun with this. No low-effort submissions.
